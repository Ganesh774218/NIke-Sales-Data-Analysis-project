
**Nike Sales Dashboard (Excel + SQL + Power BI)**

Over the past few weeks, I worked on a comprehensive **Nike Sales Analytics Project**, transforming raw data into actionable business insights.

ðŸ”¹ **Excel (Advanced):** Cleaned and prepared the raw dataset, applying advanced functions for data validation and structuring.
ðŸ”¹ **SQL:** Wrote queries to analyze monthly trends, regional performance, product profitability, and customer purchase patterns.
ðŸ”¹ **Power BI:** Designed an interactive dashboard with storytelling visuals, KPI cards, and professional aesthetics to highlight key insights (revenue, profit, product performance, and regional sales).
ðŸ”¹ **Workflow:** Cleaned and transformed the dataset in Excel â†’ imported into MySQL for querying â†’ connected to Power BI for visualization.

This project showcases my ability to integrate **data cleaning, database querying, and business intelligence tools** to deliver clear, impactful insights. Iâ€™m excited to continue sharpening my skills and connect with professionals in the **data analytics and BI space**.
